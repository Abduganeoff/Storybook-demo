Documentation and examples for the Surface component.

## Definition

A Surface is a basic UI element that emulates a physical surface including elevation, background color, and shadow to imply hierarchy and depth. It is often used to create cards, dialogs, and other components that require a visual distinction from other content.

## Usage

The Surface component elevates the content visually by applying a shadow and can be used to organize information in a clear and coherent manner. Surfaces can support various configurations such as squared or rounded edges, and with or without an outline.
